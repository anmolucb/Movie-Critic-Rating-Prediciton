The movie industry is a complex and dynamic field, with many factors influencing the success of a movie. Independent movie producers often have limited resources at their disposal, and face significant challenges in producing and marketing their movies.
The motivation of this project was to provide them with the data tools they need to effectively optimize their budgets and compete with larger production houses. Using data analytics, financiers and producers can use different classification and regression techniques to predict various movie characteristic such as ratings, and to identify patterns and trends in the data. In this project, we described the data used in the analysis, the methods and models employed, and the results obtained. We used Rotten Tomato dataset which included movie attributes such as genre, runtime, director, critic rating and reviews. We trained several ML models on this dataset and also performed Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict critic ratings of an upcoming movie.
